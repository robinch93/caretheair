numpy - numerical python.
use of numpy arrays. eg:
np.zeroes(3) - this will create numpy array with three arguments as zero.

For a fire to take place, you need higher temperatur, higher oxygen content, and lower humidity.

The data set used is Forest_fire.csv , which has columns like oxygen, temp, humidity and fire occurence.
the data is filed in this way:
1 - value 1 is given when oxygen is high, temp is high and humidity content is low.
0 - value 0 is given when low oxygen, low temp, and high humidity value.
40 rows are filled so that machine learning model can learn from this data.

used Logistic Regression form scikit learn library.
used train test split.
pickle is a package which converts the data in python program in searilized form, so all the objects
can be sent one by one in serial form to whoever is going to use it.

the termns like .. MSE(mean square), MAE(mean average) and R2 score are necessary to find how accurate your ML model is.

- If the data are too much scattered and nature of the problem is highly non-linear your R2 value would be less. If data are normally distributed and problem is linear you will get good R2 value.

- What you want is a balance between overfit (very low MSE for training data) and underfit (very high MSE for test/validation/unseen data).

- RMSE and MSE are almost more important than the R2. R2 is completed and confirming error factors.
